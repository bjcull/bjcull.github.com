title: Setting up a SOAP WebService with SSL using Configurationless WCF
published: false
---

WCF is notorious for being overengineered and difficult to setup, however, these days there are many shortcuts you can take advantage of to get something up and running in no time.

This post will outline how to quickly setup a WCF Webservice to use SOAP, with support for SSL, the configurationless way. Let's dig in.

## Step 1: Create the project
We want File > New Project > WCF > WCF Service Application

* NEW PROJECT IMAGE HERE *

You'll notice that we start with a service already made for us. Each service consists of an interace (IService1.cs) and the actual service code (Service1.svc).

The interface defines what our web service will look like to the outside world and the rest of our code will live in the .svc file.

### IService1.cs ###

Firstly, let's look at the interface. Really, it's just the same as a normal interface with a couple of extra attributes. The `[ServiceContract]` and `[OperationContract]` attributes. The service contract attribute lets WCF know that this interface represents a web service, and the operation contract lets it know that the methods should be a part of that service.

    [ServiceContract]
    public interface IService1
    {
        [OperationContract]
        string GetData(int value);

        [OperationContract]
        CompositeType GetDataUsingDataContract(CompositeType composite);
    }

There is also an example of Data Contracts just below, we'll leave it there for now. The `[DataContract]` attribute allows the class to be serialized to JSON or XML so it can be returned by the web service. The `[DataMember]` attribute let's the class know which properties to serialize and which to ignore.

    [DataContract]
    public class CompositeType
    {
        bool boolValue = true;
        string stringValue = "Hello ";

        [DataMember]
        public bool BoolValue
        {
            get { return boolValue; }
            set { boolValue = value; }
        }

        [DataMember]
        public string StringValue
        {
            get { return stringValue; }
            set { stringValue = value; }
        }
    }


### Service1.svc ###



- WCF Service Application
- Add new item, Global Application Handler
- System.ServiceModel.Activation
- AspNetCompatibilityRequirements attribute
- serviceHostingEnvironment web.config entry
- Add https
