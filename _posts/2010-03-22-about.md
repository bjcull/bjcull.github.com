Hi, my name is Benjii and I live in Brisbane, Australia.

I am a professional .NET developer who loves to code. I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and share what I've learned with others. This blog is an outlet for my excitement with new technologies and methods. If I figure something out, there's no doubt i'll talk about it here.

The best way to find out more about me is to <a href="http://www.google.com.au/?q=Ben+Cull">Google Me</a>
