Last week I was asked to provide the live tiles for my application to put towards a “Wall of Live Tiles” display that Microsoft will be showing off in an upcoming event for Windows Phone 7. I was more than happy to join the wall, but my tiles weren’t exactly the greatest looking things in the world. I’d like to say they were “practical” but really I was just being lazy. Either way I needed to come up with some new tiles, and fast. Here are the results of my spree in my favourite accent colours:
