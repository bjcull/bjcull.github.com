TwitLinkz takes your favourite twitter feeds, pulls out the links and summarizes the articles for you. It’s as simple as that.

If you source your up to the minute news from twitter, Twitlinkz is a great way to browse the headlines.

Available in the marketplace now, **TwitLinkz is free **and is set to change the way you get your real-time information.

## What does it actually do?

Here’s the step by step:

1.  Follow a twitter feed like #wp7, @benjii22 or “Australia”
2.  TwitLinkz searches the twitter feed for any links that were posted
3.  TwitLinkz fetches and summarizes the articles
4.  You enjoy a list of headlines with article summaries relevant to you
