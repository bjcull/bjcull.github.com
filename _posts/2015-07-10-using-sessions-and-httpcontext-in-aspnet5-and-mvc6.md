If you've started work on a new ASP.NET 5, MVC 6 application you may have noticed that Sessions don't quite work the way they did before. Here's how to get up and running the new way.

## Remove DNX Core Reference  
Asp.Net 5 Sessions aren't supported by the DNX Core Runtime. You'll need to remove it from your `project.json` file. If it's already not there, beautiful you don't need to do anything :)

    "frameworks": {
        "dnx451": { },
        "dnxcore50": { } // <-- Remove this line
    },

## Add Session NuGet Package  
Add the `Microsoft.AspNet.Session` NuGet package to your project.

**VERSION WARNING:** If you're using ASP.NET 5 before RTM, make sure the beta version is the same across your whole project. Just look at your references and make sure they all end with beta4 (or whichever version you're using).

## Update startup.cs  
Now that we have the Session nuget package installed, we can add sessions to the OWIN pipline.

Open up `startup.cs` and add the `AddSession()` and `AddCaching()` lines to the `ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)`

    // Add MVC services to the services container.
    services.AddMvc();
    services.AddSession();
    services.AddCaching();

Next, we'll tell OWIN to use a Memory Cache to store the session data. Add the `UseInMemorySession()` call below.

    // IMPORTANT: This session call MUST go before UseMvc()
    // Add Session data to an In-Memory Cache
    app.UseInMemorySession();

    // Add MVC to the request pipeline.
    app.UseMvc(routes =>
    {
        routes.MapRoute(
            name: "default",
            template: "{controller}/{action}/{id?}",
            defaults: new { controller = "Home", action = "Index" });

        // Uncomment the following line to add a route for porting Web API 2 controllers.
        // routes.MapWebApiRoute("DefaultApi", "api/{controller}/{id?}");
    });

## Where's the Session variable gone?  
Controllers no longer have an exposed property for Session. You now have to use dependency injection to get at the Session object. Let's add it to our Home Controller. You may also notice that this is the correct way to access the HttpContext, regardless of what type of web server you're running.

    public class HomeController : Controller
    {
        private readonly IHttpContextAccessor _httpContextAccessor;
        private ISessionCollection _session => _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.Session;

        public HomeController(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)
        {
            _httpContextAccessor = httpContextAccessor;
        }

        public IActionResult Index()
        {
            _session.SetString("Test", "Ben Rules!");
            return View();
        }

        public IActionResult About()
        {
            ViewBag.Message = _session.GetString("Test");

            return View();
        }
    }

Let's break this down.

Firstly I'm setting up a private variable to hold the HttpContextAccessor. This is the way you get the HttpContext now.

Next I'm adding a convenience variable as a shortcut directly to the session. Notice the `=>`? That means we're using an expression body, aka a shortcut to writing a one liner method that returns something.

Moving to the contructor you can see that I'm injecting the IHttpContextAccessor and assigning it to my private variable. If you're not sure about this whole dependency injection thing, don't worry, it's not hard to get the hang of (especially constructor injection like I'm using here) and it will improve your code by forcing you to write it in a modular way.

Next you'll see the `Index()` and `About()` methods making use of the Session object. It's pretty easy here, just use one of the `Set()` methods to store your data. But wait a minute, how do I store a complex object?

## How do I store a complex object?  
I've got you covered here too. Here's a quick JSON storage extension to let you store complex objects nice and simple.

    public static class JsonSessionCollectionExtensions
    {
        public static void SetObjectAsJson(this ISessionCollection session, string key, object value)
        {
            session.SetString(key, JsonConvert.SerializeObject(value));
        }

        public static T GetObjectFromJson<T>(this ISessionCollection session, string key)
        {
            var value = session.GetString(key);

            return value == null ? default(T) : JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<T>(value);
        }
    }

Now you can store your complex objects like so:

    var myComplexObject = new MyClass();
    _session.SetObjectAsJson("Test", myComplexObject);

and retrieve them just as easily:

    var myComplexObject = _session.GetObjectFromJson<MyClass>("Test");


Since the API's are still in beta at the time of writing, you should keep an eye on the [ASP.NET Session Repository](https://github.com/aspnet/Session) for any changes.
