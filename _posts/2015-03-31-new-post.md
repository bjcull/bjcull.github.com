# REST API Pagination, Sorting and Filtering using WebAPI and OData

Adding pagination, sorting and filtering to your WebAPI project is a breeze thanks to the built in support for OData Query Syntax. Don't worry, you don't need to alter any of your output, as the support is just for the query syntax and not the whole OData protocol. There's only a few things you need to do to get up and running so let's take a look.

## Set up OData Query Syntax Support

**Add the WebAPI OData Nuget Package**

[Insert nuget snippet here]


**Update WebAPI Config**

Add the following line to your `WebApiConfig.cs`:

    config.AddODataQueryFilter();

This line enables the OData Query Syntax parsing.

**Update your Endpoints**

This part is easy, just return an IQueryable instead of an IEnumerable and add the `EnableQuery` attribute to your method.

    [EnableQuery]
    public IQueryable<ProductDto> Get()
    {
        return _productCategoryRepository.Queryable().Select(ProductDto.Projection);
    }


## OData Query Parameters

**$top**  
Takes the first X results.  
Example: `/api/product/?$top=5`

**$skip**  
Skips the first X results.  
Example: `/api/product/?$skip=5`

**$filter**  
Filters the results based on the given expression. Available operators include:  

 - gt - Greater than. `/api/product/?$filter=ID gt 3`
 - lt - Less than. `/api/product/$filter=ID lt 5`
 - eq - Equal to. `/api/product/$filter=ID eq 45`

**$orderby**  
Orders the results by the given expression.  
Example: `/api/product/$orderby=ID desc`
