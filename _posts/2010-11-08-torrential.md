[![SmallApplicationTile_99x99](/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/SmallApplicationTile_99x991.png "SmallApplicationTile_99x99")](http://social.zune.net/redirect?type=phoneApp&amp;id=399b34ba-3eeb-df11-9264-00237de2db9e "Download Torrential for Windows Phone 7") Torrential is a brand new uTorrent Controller App for Windows Phone 7. Manage your torrents on the go, as well as be notified when they are complete.

You can quickly and easily search for torrents from the popular torrent hub, Isohunt using the built in search.

## Coming in Version 1.3.0

#### Auto Refresh

Simple but effective, the torrent list will constantly refresh whilst inside the app. You will be able to set the refresh interval on the settings page.

#### Live Tiles

No I'm not talking about one of your kitchen tiles gaining sentience, I'm talking about glanceable information on your windows phone 7 live tile for Torrential. Some feedback about what information you would like on there would be great. [Contact Me if you have any ideas](../contact-me/ "Contact Me").

## Updates

### Version 1.2.0 – 5 December 2010

#### Add Torrents from the Web Browser

By popular demand, I have changed the next scheduled release to include adding torrents from the web browser. I have also built a trial version to let you guys have a poke around before deciding this app is for you. Expect this one in the marketplace within the next few days.

#### Individual Files within a Torrent

This one just made it into this release. You can now view the individual files within a torrent.

#### Shake to Refresh

Sick of touching the screen? You can now simply shake your phone and it will refresh your torrent list and torrent screen!

### Version 1.1.0 - 17 November 2010

#### Filtered Torrent List

That's right, first cab off the rank is the torrent list. We all know and love our singular aggregate lists, but what if life offered you more, in the form of filtered lists? You'd be ecstatic right? Me too. Look for this gem next week after the update is rolled out over the weekend.

### Version 1.0.0 - 11 November 2010

We’re at version one baby, yeah!
