I was lucky enough to be invited to talk at NDC Oslo about the state of online payments. 
In this talk I introduce you to the world of online payments, from the first transaction to the latest trends and technologies.

I wrap up with a coding demo showing just how easy it is to process a payment using Stripe.

I'm always keen for feedback, so be sure to tweet me your thoughts.

Cheers,

Ben
